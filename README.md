# Equation-Solver
Equation Solver is an extensible Python framework for modeling, solving, and analyzing linear and quadratic equations using object-oriented design and closed-form analytical methods. The project emphasizes mathematical correctness through enforced constraints, abstraction, and structured result interpretation.
